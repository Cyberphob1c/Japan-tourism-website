        <li> Yakumo Saryō</li>
        <img class="tokyoimages" src="../img/yakumo.jpeg">
        <p class="caption">For a rejuvenating start to the day indulge with a Japanese breakfast at Yakumo Saryo. Designed by architect Shinichiro Ogata, the teahouse is a tranquil space offering a morning of peace and mindfulness. The asacha (morning tea) set breakfast includes a variety of teas, porridge, fish, pickles, miso soup, and wagashi (confections) to finish. Reservations are required.</p>


        <li>Bar Benfiddich</li>
        <img class="tokyoimages" src="../img/Benfiddich.jpeg">
        <p class="caption">Hiroyasu Kayama's atmospheric, candle-lit ninth-floor hideaway is one of Tokyo’s most compelling bars, with shelves crammed with rare spirits and jars of obscure aromatics, and drinks just as likely to involve a mortar and pestle as a cocktail shaker. Sink into one of the half-dozen armchairs at the ancient-wood counter and give Kayama carte blanche to work his mixologist magic. Best to get there early, though: Bar Benfiddichs fame extends far beyond the Shinjuku back streets.</p>

        <li>Onigiri Manma </li>
        <img class="tokyoimages" src="../img/onigiri.jpeg">
        <p class="caption"> Manma, an onigiri (rice ball) shop, sits in the shadow of the Shinjuku Isetan department store. Onigiri are a classic comfort food, but Manma’s draw is its unique fillings: Popular options include a “mother and child” of grilled salmon with sujiko salmon roe, seasoned ground meat with cured egg yolk, and bacon with cream cheese. The only side dishes — all that’s really needed — are miso soup and tsukemono, pickles. The casual seating is at the counter, so everyone has front-row seats to watch the staff assemble giant rice balls. Expect a queue for a seat, but you can also take to-go orders (usually faster) to the nearby Shinjuku Gyoen park for an impromptu picnic.</p>
